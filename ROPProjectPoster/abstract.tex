{\large The success of drilling a well for geothermal, oil, and gas purposes are quantified by how quickly the desired depth is reached. The progress of a drilling operation is determined by the drill bits rate of penetration (ROP). In our research we use machine learning models to make the drilling process more efficient by predicting the ROP considering the  weight on bit (WOB), revolutions per minute (RPM), surface torque, and flow rate. Using data from \cite{oedi_1111}, we cleaned, integrated, and performed exploratory data analysis to train regression models that we evaluated and improved. We concluded that the model best applicable is Random Forest because of its efficiency in training time, memory consumption, and simplicity.}
