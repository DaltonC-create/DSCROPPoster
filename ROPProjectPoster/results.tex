{\large After evaluating several machine learning models on our dataset, we have identified $\color{red}Random Forest$ as the best model for our dataset. This model achieved the highest R2 score of $\color{red}0.9358$ and the lowest RMSE of $\color{red}0.2320$. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions, which results in a more accurate and stable model compared to other models. In our case, we used $\color{red}200$ trees with the Gini impurity criterion. We recommend using this model for future predictions on our dataset.  }
